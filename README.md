Sprint Review and Retrospective

Throughout this course, I was able to learn a great deal regarding the diverse roles available for agile methodology. An interesting journey that was worth taking as it helped me expand my knowledge and gave me yet another useful tool to help me in the professional arena when the time arrives for that.

When it comes to interpreting user needs and implementing them into programs, I find that the best approach is to always understand why the user is using the application in the first place, and what expected results they are seeking from it. This involves conducting extensive interviews in which we get a better idea of how to remediate their concerns, or in what way we could improve upon a feature that they liked.

This leads into user stories, which are an incredibly powerful way of allowing us to understand where each user is coming from. With user stories, we can get very direct and detailed explanations, which through rigorous testing and constant feedback, allows us to tailor the application to an even better final product.

Due to communication being such an important key in agile development, the best way for handling developing programs in my opinion boils down to effective communication with all the necessary stakeholders. By incorporating the agile methodology, we gather the pertinent information, begin to carve out a design with the UI/UX team, and finally begin to develop and test the application before deploying it. With Agile, developing on big projects becomes an efficient process that allows us to be more innovative and cutting edge.

Being a good team member is all about communication as previously stated. In a collaborative principle like Agile, being able to communicate your ideas to your teammates could either make or break a project. Communication goes far beyond speaking to one another, as respect, and an ability to receive and communicate constructive criticisms are a must. One canâ€™t be too overly harsh with constructive criticisms, as they are meant to each grow, and fostering an environment of healthy and open communication amongst team members, whether through zoom meetings, or stand ups, is truly the secret key that allows projects of scaling complexities to be done in a timely manner.
